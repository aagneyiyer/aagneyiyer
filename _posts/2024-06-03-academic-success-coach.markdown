## Why Not?

I saw a job posting in April of 2023 on the CSE undergraduate discussion forum for "Allen School Academic Success Coach".

> This position will work with all students across the University of Washington while having a concentration in understanding and supporting students within the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. The coach will collaborate directly with advisers and staff within the Allen School to develop resources, host workshops, and provide general academic support for both prospective CSE students and in-major students. 

*Why not?* I probably won't end up doing it - the possibility seems so far off, and I lose nothing by sending in an application. When I got an interview, I accepted it with the same mentality - why not? When I received the offer letter, I figured that the job seemed like something I would enjoy and be good at. Besides, I'd be getting paid for it. I accepted.


## Thoughts and Reflections

I worked this job for about 10-12 hours a week for the whole academic year. The people I worked with were excellent, from my managers to my coworkers. Hands down the friendliest people I've met at UW.

In terms of the meetings I'd have with students, it truly varied.

Sometimes, it would be painful. It's very hard to tell students the boring things they already know are true. You need to put distractions away. You need to use some sort of calendar or planner. You need to get started early and break assignments down into manageable pieces. Indeed, seeing students faces as they realize that I have no better advice than common sense was a bit painful.

Then, there were the middle-of-the-road meetings. The kind where I explained how I use practice tests to study for any STEM exam. The student would leave somewhat satisfied and with a gameplan.

My favorite type of meeting though, is when a student would essentially come to me as if I were a traditional academic advisor, seeking help choosing classes or navigating their major or minor requirements. Here, I felt the most useful as I have a lot of good off-the-record advice to give. Students left these meetings confident and satisfied.

I felt I brought a very informal demeanor to these meetings. I figured that too much professionalism would stiffen up interactions. This sometimes led me to making friends with students that came in.
