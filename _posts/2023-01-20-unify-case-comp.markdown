## 1st Place

The 2023 Unify Case competition was a three-day event sponsored by Accenture, with 16 teams. The prize was $2,000 for the winning team and a first-round interview with Accenture. Most of these teams were affiliated with various business clubs on campus, but my team of four independent participants somehow snuck its way to the top of the podium. This was my first taste of business at UW, and I liked the feeling of winning, so maybe I'll stick around. 

I also really liked the team I was put on. Case competitions are a great way to meet quality individuals. The pressure of being rushed for time really creates a bond.

## Aagney's Guide to Victory

Case competitions remind me a lot of DECA in high school. The skillset isn't much different; some rhetoric, common sense, and good presentation skills will carry you far. Throw in some fancy finance terms to differentiate your team from opponents, and you're good to go.
