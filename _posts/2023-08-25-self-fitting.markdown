## Objective

This was a research project I completed with the Applied Hearing Science Lab at UW.

Traditionally, fitting hearing aids requires audiometric tests using specialized equipment, as well as fine tuning that may be conducted across several weeks. We aim to make this process more streamlined and accessible to the 85% of hearing-impaired Americans with unmet hearing healthcare needs.

How will we accomplish this? Our lab has developed a mobile-based web app that allows patients to adjust settings on their own hearing aids, and fit their exact audiometric profile. This process is called “self-fitting”. We aimed to make the app as accessible and easy to use as possible for elderly patients with less familiarity with modern apps.

## Outcome

I implemented a new fitting interface with options to apply decibel gain to different frequencies on users’ hearing aids. Similar to the grid interface, the user is taken through several trials, which iteratively improve their hearing aid experience. Aside from this new button interface, we wanted to give the app a total aesthetic redesign to make it both user-friendly for older patients and more presentable to potential funders of our lab.All that I worked on this summer can be seen [here](https://github.com/AHSLab-UW/self-fitting-gui). I enjoyed the interdisciplinarity of the team that I worked on. I learned a ton about audiology and acoustics from Bertan, the PhD student leading the project. He answered all my questions - even the shockingly obvious ones.
