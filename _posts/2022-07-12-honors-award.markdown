## Random Blessing

I'm sitting in the office of my unpaid internship. I can't remember what I was doing on my phone, probably scrolling Instagram. I get an Outlook notification: **UW Honors Scholarship Letter**

*Um, what the fuck?*

I click it and stare. 

> Dear Aagney,

> Congratulations! We are pleased that you will be joining the University of Washington Honors Program in Autumn 2022. We have also selected you for the **2022 Honors Undergraduate Scholar Award**, which covers tuition for your autumn 2022-spring 2026 resident UW tuition (full-time enrollment, WA residents only).

> This year over 5,800 students applied to the Honors Program, competing for 225 spaces and the small number of awards that we offer. You have worked hard to get to this point, and we are excited to see what you will contribute to our remarkable and diverse student body. This award confirms our confidence in your abilities and promise.

## About Time

God shouldn't have done this to my ego. I just got the most deserved humbling of my life after being rejected from every private school I applied to. And then this happens? This makes up for all those rejections. I did feel a little disappointed to end up at my state school after working so hard in high school and obsessing over college applications. But this? I think I'm okay with this.
