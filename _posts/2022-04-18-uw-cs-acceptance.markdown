## It's Official

After over 20 applications and dozens of essays, not to mention the thousands of hours poured into grades, testing, and extracurriculars during the years leading up to today, I have finalized my destination: the University of Washington. And while I am excited, I can't help but feel that this outcome is a bit anticlimatic. To clarify, I certainly don't use the term 'anticlimactic' to diminish the Allen School and its caliber. Instead, I use it in the context of my exorbitant expectations going into the college application process. These expectations were largely based on an unfounded sense of entitlement. I had the misconception that I was somehow *deserving* of a T10 admission above other students - that my near-perfect stats and stellar application should have guaranteed me a spot, or at least a fighting chance, in any institution that I applied to. 

As I learned, this was not the case. Looking ahead though, I am excited to attend UW. Aside from the high-quality program, I feel I belong at the Allen School, and being so familiar with the school and city will help me thrive.

Also, I got into the Honors Program at UW. The acceptance rate was around 5%, which definitely made me feel good. I'm not actually too keen on the Honors curriculum, but it's a nice addition and I lose noting by accepting.

## Reviewing my College Admissions Process

### My Application

I had a 4.0 unweighted GPA, with around a dozen A-Level and AP classes. I scored a 1590 on my SAT, with a perfect 800 on the Math section. I scored mostly 4s and 5s on AP exams. My extracurriculars were mostly club-based; I had numerous international and national placements at DECA and TSA, as well as a chapter leadership position in the latter. I also co-founded my school's ACLU chapter in junior year, admittedly almost entirely as a means of boosting my application. These were the main highlights of my application, along with varsity and club soccer and some bullshit nonprofit work (you know the types).

### Admissions and Rejections

I applied to 23 (!) schools, which I selected with the utmost care and consideration, taking into account many highly personalized factors and carefully weighing all the tradeoffs. In other words, I glanced at the US News Top 20 Schools list and called it good. 

I was rejected from every single private school I applied to, including Stanford's Restrictive Early Action. My only other admission worth considering over UW CS was Georgia Tech CS. I'm quite proud of getting in, and I probably would have picked GT had I lived anywhere else, but it's just more practical for me to choose UW, being from the area and all. 

### Regrets 

It's hard to have regrets when I did what I thought was best at every step of this process. However, what I thought was best, was not actually best. And I can't blame myself for that. But if I could go back in time, here's what I would tell 2021 Aagney. 

- **Apply to Carnegie Mellon ED**. Their decisions process, from what I can tell, is a bit more suited to your application. Stanford focuses much more on the intangibles - the intellectual qualities that transcend a resume - but if I'm correct, CMU is not this way. 
- **Realize how generic your application is**. Think about how many DECA chapters there are in the nation, now think about how many regional, state, and national placements occur each year. I know those ICDC placements mean a lot to you, and I'm not saying it didn't take intelligence and work ethic to earn those, but they make you blend in. You don't want to blend in. Maybe try to frame your ECs differently or something.
- **Write better essays, I guess?**. This one's hard because I still don't think I could write great essays if I tried now. Maybe this means I'm genuinely unqualified, or maybe I have no interesting life experiences. Or maybe the former is true because of the latter. Either way, when you have tens of thousands of applicants, the only way to differentiate them becomes qualitative, so realize that essays portray your intellect more than your GPA, SAT, and ECs do. Watch @admitium's videos on IG, he gets it.

### Overall Thoughts

Like I said, I don't regret much. My high school work ethic and perseverance still built up my character even if I didn't get into my dream schools. Here's a quote from Admitium's YouTube channel that I think sums it up really well:

> Those Saturday mornings you studied for exams made you more disciplined. Those homework problems you solved made you a better thinker. All those hours competing on sports fields made you resilient. All that hard work wasn’t for nothing, because even if you don’t get into a college that’s your top choice, you are a more interesting, dynamic, and skilled person for making the effort.

This is all a long way of saying that you either win or you learn. Words to live by.

## Looking Ahead

All things considered, I'm really proud of my admission to UW CS. I am one of seven from my school attending the program, and the admissions rate is around 25%. From LinkedIn surfing and anecdotes I've heard, UW CS has a high rate of FAANG intern and full-time outcomes. Being in a tech hub like Seattle, this is only natural. More importantly, I'm excited to attend. I am guaranteed to have friends and a good time.
