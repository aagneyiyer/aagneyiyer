		<p class="article" style="font-size:1.8em; font-weight:600; margin-bottom:1vh;">Inertia</p>
		
		<p class="article">Though I didn't take a PHYS class this quarter, the word I would use to sum up my first couple months at the UW would be "inertia". It's a simple principle that I learned at a young age:</p>
		
		<p class="list"><b>in·er·tia (aagney's definition):</b> an object at rest will stay at rest until another force comes along to move it.</p>
		
		<p class="article">I've been a frequent victim of inertia throughout this past quarter.
		I found myself spending afternoons, weeknights, and even Friday nights locked in my dorm room scrolling on my phone to kill time. I've had my fair share of battles with inertia in years past, but there's always been some motivating factor to keep me moving.</p>
		
		<p class="article">Namely, growing up with club soccer practice and games gave me something to structure my days around, not to mention good exercise. Three or four rest days a week during the soccer season was fine, but seven has me feeling a bit purposeless.
		I forgot to sign up for 3v3 IMA soccer, but that’s no excuse when you own a pair of cleats, a ball, and live a ten second elevator ride down from Denny field. Truth be told, without the commitment of an organized team, I ditched the sport. I'm hoping that IMA futsal will spark a glorious turnaround in winter quarter - only three days till registration opens!</p>
			
		<p class="article">Extracurricular clubs also took up a lot of my time in high school. Meetings, projects, leadership positions, and volunteering were time commitments that kept me feeling productive.
		I didn’t have the most involved quarter outside my classes. I started a research position, joined a couple clubs’ discord servers, and that’s about it. For winter quarter, I’ve scouted two clubs that spark my interest: Husky Coding Project and Software Engineering Career Club. Though I'm hesitant, commiting to at least one of these clubs sounds fulfilling.</p>
		
		<p class="heading">A Word on Academics</p>

		<p class="article">I had a conversation with my good friend about how filling up your schedule with non-schoolwork actually makes you complete your schoolwork more productively. Without other commitments - whether sports, socialization, or clubs - schoolwork seems to expand to fill up your time. 
		But having those commitments forces you to make the most out of the limited time you have, and you therefore get more done in a shorter period. That's a good observation. <br><br>Fall quarter, I took a 16 credit courseload that consisted of three main classes and two one-credit classes. MATH 126 (Calculus III) and CSE 351 proved to take up most of my time. With 126, I felt very confident grasping the course's content, but
		found it difficult to perform well on the midterms. Whereas past exams from other professors follow a fairly straightforward format, including one predictable problem from each sub-unit, <a style="color:black" href="http://sites.math.washington.edu/~jonozhu/cv.html">Professor Jonathan Zhu</a>'s exams felt much more conceptual and tricky, albeit some of his questions exposed gaps in my understanding. 
		Zhu is a young yet deeply experienced scholar with Mathematics degrees from MIT and Harvard, as well as research experience at Princeton and ANU, so difficult exams were to be expected.<br><br>
	 	With <a style="color:black" href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse351/22au/syllabus.html">CSE 351</a>, I felt the opposite. The course material was very unfamiliar and abstract at times, but performing well in the class was mostly labor-based. Titled "The Hardware and Software Interface", this class dealt with low-level programming topics and "under the hood" concepts. 
		These include number representation, assembly, procedures, stacks, memory management/layout, caches, processes, virtual memory, and memory allocation. Instructed by the talented Professor Justin Hsia, the course was structured excellently and taught me a lot. I might do a full blog post reviewing it.<br><br>
		I also took an HONORS social science class about essential hospitals in the United States titled "Safety-Net Hospitals in the US: Past, Present, and Future". Taught by Dr. Maralyssa Bann, MD, the class was quite insightful. As the course title suggests, it was divided into three units that consisted of the past, present, and future of essential hospitals. The first part felt more like a history class about healthcare in the US, 
		and from there it became an examination of the current state of these facilities and how they might be improved. Dr. Bann narrated eye-opening, often disturbing medical stories from her time at Harborview Medical Center. Teaching this class was a passion project of hers, and it was a pleasure to be one of her students.<br><br>My last two credits came from HONORS 100, a first year seminar for the honors program, and CSE 391. 391 was mostly an asynchronous class, whose class meetings took the form of optional office hours. The point of this class is to teach important Unix command line tools that might not be explicitly covered in a CS degree.
		We learned Unix shell commands, Git, regular expressions, permissions, and shell scripting.  
	
		<p class="article" style="font-size:1.8em; font-weight:600; ">The Bad</p>
		
		<p class="article"><b>Internships</b>: Demoralizing, draining, depressing, and seemingly hopeless. Those are the words I would use to sum up my experience searching for internships so far. I feel like I did everything I was supposed to. Craft a beautiful resume. Use key words. Format it properly. Spam apply. Spam apply some more, and then some more. Yet the more companies I apply to, the more futile it all feels.<br>
		I did receive a few general coding assessment invitations: mostly automated emails, I suspect, from companies that had long fulfilled their intern roles in the prior months. But it wouldn't matter anyways, for my lack of algorithms experience killed whatever sliver of hope I might've had. I'm reaching the point of defeat, and beginning to accept that I'll have to 
		just put my head down and focus on the present. I'll keep trying for now...</p>

		<p class="article"><b>Sickness</b>: I'm perpetually sick at college. Sore throat, cough, congestion. It slowly gets worse, then slowly gets better, and I'm recovered for about five days. Then it starts again, but the symptoms are different. Fatigue, cough, chills, but no sore throat. And the cycle repeats, my body mixing and matching random symptoms to create some unprecedented megadisease that apparently falls somewhere between COVID, the Flu, and RSV.
		The doctors that I've visited, however, have dismissed my suffering as nothing to worry about. Performing well in school, I've learned, is extremely tough when ill.</p>
				
		<p class="article"><b>Food</b>: I'm no picky eater. I was confident that I wouldn't get sick of college food, but my confidence began to sputter out by week seven as the nonstop stream of DubStreet Burgers and Latin Bowls (see below) slowly became insufferable. The bountiful West Campus District Market lies a lengthy 0.6 miles away from my room, but I might just have to put on my walking shoes in January if I want to cook homemade meals.
		Only a few items at the dining hall sound appetizing to me, and I have two-thirds of a school year ahead of me. </p>

		<p class="article" style="font-size:1.8em; font-weight:600; ">The Good</p>
		
		<p class="article"><b>Classmates</b>: I've met some absolutely fantastic students in my classes this quarter. They have been amazing academic supports, and I wouldn't have achieved what I did this quarter without them. One friend I met in CSE 351 helped me through a lab despite not being my partner. He spent over an hour of his own time after class sitting down with me and working through 
		my set of problems and bugs. Another student let me join his study group, where I was able to prepare myself for the midterms and final. In my math class, I sat next to a fellow soccer fanatic, who became a good friend that I studied for the final with. In my honors class, my friend always caught me up on classwork when I overslept the 8:30 AM class. </p>
		
		<p class="article"><b>COM^2</b>: I lied earlier. I'm technically part of a club called COM^2, which is basically the CSE student body club. I signed up to be a 'little' for their big-little program, and my experience so far has been nothing but positive.
		It's really casual, but that's what makes it so pleasant. My group has met a couple times for boba, and our discussions turn into productive Q&As about all things UW CS. I came away from these meetings feeling refreshed and reassured, and my big and fellow littles have been amazing.</p> 

		<p class="article"><b>CSE Building</b>: I'm not sure what we did to deserve this architectural beauty, nor am I sure why we need so many floors and rooms, but the CSE building is great. It has plenty of Linux machines and provides an exclusive study spot that's not insanely crowded all the time (Odegaard, I'm looking at you).
		I tend to want to study in my room a lot, which gets boring, but I hope to visit this place a lot more often and explore all that it has to offer.</p> 
			
		<img src="../img/aut22/cse.jpg" class="articlepic">
		
		<p><b>...</b><p>
		
		<p class="article" id="tldr"><b>tl;dr:</b> Without many commitments other than school, I found myself with little else to do but sit in my room and kill time. Next quarter, I'll try to get more active both with soccer and CS extracurriculars.
		With the stress of searching for internships, constant illness, and a growing distate for dining hall food, this quarter felt impossible at times. But my peers, mentors, and resources have been amazing supports for me. </p>
