		<p class="article">Hi there! This is my first post on this blog. In the absence of any classes, exams, clubs, and other normal scholarly obligations, I've come to an overdue realization this winter break: I like to write.
		It's one of my favorite activities, in fact. There's something uniquely satisfying about constructing coherent, concise, and pretty sentences. Without any upcoming essays looming over my head, 
		I find myself writing longer, more reflective texts to my friends, redirecting all my creative juices to just about any trivial conversation.</p>
		
		<p class="article">Realizing this curious tendency begged the question: why don't I journal? Turns out, there's an unfortunate answer: if I'm not doing something CS-y or career-y or school-y, I don't feel productive. So I made it productive! 
		By turning this hobby into a resume item, my hope is that I'll be more motivated to write out my thoughts.</p>
		
		<p class="article">So, was this blog born out of an unhealthy relationship with productivity? Perhaps. And did I spend time on this site just so I could feel good about writing? Partially. 
		But while we're here, let me introduce myself. I'm Aagney, I'm currently 18 years old, and I love soccer. I was born in India, grew up on the 
		<a style="color:black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastside_(King_County,_Washington)">Eastside</a>, went to Juanita High School in Kirkland, WA, and now attend the Unviersity of Washington. I'm a computer science major,
		and I'm learning new things about the field every day. Welcome to my website!</p>
		
		<p class="article" id="tldr"><b>tl;dr:</b> This blog was made so that I could turn a hobby of mine - writing - into a productive frontend web design project. Thanks for visiting!</p>
